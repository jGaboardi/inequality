    "# Gini-Based Measures of  Spatial Inequality and Polarization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the measurement of spatial inequality and polarization using the Gini coefficient, with a particular focus on Mexican state-level income data between 1940 and 2000.  `pysal-inequality` extends the classic Gini coefficient, which quantifies income inequality,  to account for spatial relationships among neighboring regions. By leveraging spatial weights matrices, we distinguish between inequality contributions from neighboring areas versus distant areas, enabling a deeper understanding of spatial economic disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis begins with an overview of the data, which includes decennial per capita incomes of Mexican states, followed by the calculation of the classic Gini coefficient to establish baseline inequality levels. We then extend the analysis to the spatial Gini coefficient, incorporating spatial relationships to reveal localized inequality patterns. The notebook culminates in the Gini-based spatial polarization index, which highlights the extent to which the inequality has a spatial structure.\n",
